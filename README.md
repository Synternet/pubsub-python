# PubSub Python

Welcome to the documentation for the Python SDK for the Data Layer by Synternet! This SDK allows seamless integration with our Data Layer solution, enabling you to leverage real-time data streams in your Python applications. With the Python SDK, you can unlock the power of the Data Layer and harness real-time insights for your data-driven projects.

[pubsub-python](https://github.com/Synternet/pubsub-python) is a Python example illustrating the use of the Synternet Data Layer project, which facilitates subscription to existing data streams or publishing new ones. This example employs the NATS messaging system and offers a simpler starting point for integrating Python applications with the Synternet Data Layer platform.

# Installation

To install the Python SDK for Data Layer, you can use pip, the Python package manager. Here's an example of how to install it:
